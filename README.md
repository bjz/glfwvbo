A project illustrating how to use VBOs and Shaders with Derelict3.

I still haven't got this working. It's still a WIP!

I've only tested this on OSX - there might need to be modifications to it so that it can be run on Windows and Linux.

## Dependencies

- D2: http://dlang.org/
- Derelict3: https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3
- GLFW: https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw
