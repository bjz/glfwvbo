# glfwvbo

This project is illustrate how to use VBOs and Shaders with Derelict3.

I am very much a beginner, so I would caution against using my work an example of best practices. You have been warned! :)

I've only tested this on OSX - there might need to be modifications to it so that it can be run on Windows and Linux.

# Instructions

1. Edit the makefile to match your system's configuration
2. Build the project: `$ make`
3. ...then run it: `$ make run`

If you use Sublime Text, for convenience I've set it up so that it points to the Derelict3 and Phobos directories on my machine. You'll probably want to change those as well.
